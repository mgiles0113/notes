"If you can design one thing, you can design everything."
    - Massimo Vignelli

1.1 - Design is Design is Design
================================
## Design is solving problems. Not drawing pictures.
    - does the design serve the purpose of its existence?
    - how should it be perceived and received by the audience?
    - why does that matter to anyone?
    - "If you don't have a good solution, you don't have a good problem."
        - What is it supposed to do for the user and the organization?
    - the principles of
        good graphic design
            are the same principles that dictate
                good UI design
    - "design is design is design"
        - graphic, industrial, architectural, etc...
        - starting with what needs to be accomplished
        - starting with how human beings react to what they see and why

1.2 - Stop Solving Other People's Problems
==========================================
## Do you start the design process by looking at themes?
